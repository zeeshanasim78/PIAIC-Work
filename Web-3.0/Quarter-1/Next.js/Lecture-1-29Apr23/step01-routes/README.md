This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

===================================My Notes =====================================================
Routes :
In Next.js 13 folders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder. Files are used to create UI that is shown for the route segment.

To create a route you can create a folder in the app directory. For example, you can add app/name director with its page.tsx file.

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new app/name/address route by nesting two new folders in the app directory. The /name/address route is composed of three segments:

/ (Root segment)
name (Segment)
address (Leaf segment)
