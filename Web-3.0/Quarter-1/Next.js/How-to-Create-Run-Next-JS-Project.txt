Steps to Create A Node.JS Project:
==================================
1) Please check Internet is available
If you are behind a proxy you can use command
npm config set proxy http://132.147.147.111:3128

You can also remove the proxy using command : npm config rm proxy

2) You can create a next.js project with defualt settings as
npx create-next-app@latest
The above command will ask for following information
 What is your project named? ... step-00
√ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? ...  Yes
√ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? ...  Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? ...  Yes
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? ...  Yes
√ Use App Router (recommended)? ...  Yes
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No 

The command will get latest libraries from Internet for selected options
after some time it will create the project

3) To run a next.js project we can use following commands:
npm run dev    or    yarn dev    or    pnpm dev
Note : YOu have to be in th project folder to run the project
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

4)You can start editing the page by modifying src/app/page.tsx. 
The page auto-updates as you edit the file. 
Note : In any folder normaly page.tsx file is the start point
Anything that is written in the function between return () will be shown
export default function Home() {
  return (
  )  }
  
Deployment on Vercel
=======================
Vercel is the fastest way to deploy your Next.js application with zero configuration.
In order to deploy on vercel you need a vercel account
We can deploy a vercel using command : npm i -g vercel
Now go to the Next.js project directory and give command to deploy to cloud: vercel
