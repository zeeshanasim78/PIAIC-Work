CHAPTER 1 : Database System Concepts and Architecture
====================================================================================================================================
The database management system is a collection of control routines (software package) that manages the data functionality, mainly for 
easy storage and easy retrieval. In reality, it does many other important tasks from the creation of a database to the maintenance of
a database which in turn includes the following:

Data definition: It involves specifying the data types, data structures, and constraints of the data to be stored.

Data storage: Storing data mostly on secondary storage (or server) which is controlled by DBMS.

Data manipulation: The three main informal operations are add, modify, and delete; technically inserting, querying, updating and
generating reports.

Concurrent access: The main advantage of the database management systems is concurrent access or data sharing which allows multiple
users and programs to access the data concurrently.

Data protection: The DBMS provides protection against the unauthorized access, system failure, and other catastrophic failures.

File System vs Database System
Earlier, the file system was the most popular way to store and organize the data on drives. However, nowadays, when it comes to security and
organizing of the data including constraints, many experts choose Database Management System (DBMS).

CHAPTER 2 : The Entity-Relationship Model
====================================================================================================================================
Model : A model is a template/prototype used as a sample to simulate the real-world systems. Generally, it is constructed for a better 
understanding of future solutions.

Why to make a “Model”?
A model allows you to test your solution quickly and cost-effectively. You could use the model for demonstrating to the clients and ask
for design approval if design is what they are looking for?

What do you mean by “Data Model” and why do we need to create it?
A data model is a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the schema of a database. The schema of a database defines what the 
entities are along with their data types, relationships, and constraints that needs to be applied to the data.

Database Model
A database model defines the logical schema of the data. The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
For a database design, many models have been in use. They are listed as follows:
	Hierarchical model
	Network model
	ER model
	Relational model
	
A hierarchical database model is the oldest data model and uses a tree-like data structure to organize the data. The hierarchical model 
is useful to the data which has inherent hierarchies such as an organizational chart. It has a single parent and can have one or more children,
that is, the parent:child has 1:N relationship. 

A network database model was formalized by the Database Task Group for flexible representation of objects and their relationships. 
It uses the graph data structure and can be visualized as a superset of the hierarchical model. 

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model was introduced by Chen in 1976. It is a popular high-level conceptual data model. An ER model is a 
conceptual design of the database. In the ER model, the main components are entity, attribute, and relrelationship. For designing an 
ER Model, we will follow relationship. For designing an ER Model, we will follow Chen’s notations. 

Entity : The following are the features of an entity:
	* An entity is a “thing” that can be distinctly identified.
	* An entity represents something that exists in the real world and we want to maintain some data about them.
	* A specific person, company, or event is an example of an entity.
	* An entity can be the following:
		A physical object - for example, House, Car, Player, etc.
		A logical concept - for example, Job, Course, Server, etc.
	* Entities are represented by labeled rectangles. The label is the name of the entity.
	* Entity names should be singular nouns. And preferably represented by 	all characters in capital.

The following are the features of an entity set:
	A database is modeled as a collection of entities and relationships among the entities.
	An entity is a physical object, or a logical thing described by attributes.
	In the ER model, every entity is represented with the name of the entity and set of attributes.

CHAPTER 4 : Structured Query Language and Indexing
====================================================================================================================================
The features of SQL, as illustrated in Figure 4.1, are defined as follows:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)  :  Basically, the DDL commands are used to create and modify the database  
objects. SQL DDL provides the various commands for defining, modifying, and deleting the existing relation schemas.

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
The DML commands are used to manage the data. Data manipulations can be achieved by inserting, deleting, or modifying the tuples.

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
DCL controls the access rights and permissions of the users. The access rights and permissions can be assigned or withdrawn by using the GRANT
and REVOKE commands.

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
TCL is used to manage the transactions in the database. The SQL TCL commands are used for specifying the explicit beginning and end of the
transactions as well as for providing the commands for Rollback, Savepoint, and Commit.

5. View definition
Views can be considered a virtual table which helps restrict the data access. The SQL DDL includes the commands for defining the views.

6. Embedded data manipulation language
The embedded form of SQL is designed for use within the generalpurpose programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, .NET etc.,
for combining the computing power of a programming language and the database manipulation capabilities of SQL. It helps to relate and integrate
the other systems and programs of the real world, such as the Web-based applications.

7. Data Integrity
Data integrity is the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data in the database. It will protect the data from any unwanted or unintended
changes while managing
