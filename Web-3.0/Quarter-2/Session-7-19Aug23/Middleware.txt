Middleware

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware

Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by 
rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly. Middleware runs before cached content and 
routes are matched. 

Matching Paths : Middleware will be invoked for every route in your project. The following is the execution order:

headers from next.config.js
redirects from next.config.js
Middleware (rewrites, redirects, etc.)
beforeFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js
Filesystem routes (public/, _next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)
afterFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js
Dynamic Routes (/blog/[slug])
fallback (rewrites) from next.config.js
There are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:

Convention
Use the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app,
 or inside src if applicable. So we will create the middleware.ts file in the src directory(Not in the app directory)
