We learn will Pyhton from Scratch
You will need to Install Anaconda here. As it contains all the basic libraries of Python

Now move to the folder where you want to save the files. OPen VScode from that using vcode .

Install the Python Intellisence for Python Extension int he Visual Studio Code

IF we want to make a python file save it as .py
If we want to make a Jupyter Notebook file we can save it as .ipynb

You can create environment for a specific Pyhton version as  :
conda create --name envpy3.12 python=3.12

To view all already existing created Environments use command : conda env list

To activate an environment : conda activate environment_name
