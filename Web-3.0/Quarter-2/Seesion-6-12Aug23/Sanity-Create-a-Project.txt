 Sanity is a platform for creating and working with structured content. Your content is stored in the cloud and can be distributed anywhere,
 for example on a website or in an app.
 
 Step 1: Install Sanity Studio
You start by setting up your content editing environment. Itâ€™s called Sanity Studio, and you can configure and customize it with 
JavaScript. It runs in the browser. To develop locally, we need to run a development server so you can see your changes instantly.

To install Sanity Studio you'll first need to have node and npm installed. To get started, run this in your command line:
npm create sanity@latest -- --template clean --create-project "Sanity Project" --dataset production

This will take you through a setup process by guiding you through the following steps:

ðŸ‘‰  Create an account. Select a login provider from the list of options, and confirm with Enter. After creating an account in the browser, come back to the command line window.
ðŸ‘‰  Choose an output path. Press Enter to accept the default path, or change it to fit your needs first.
ðŸ‘‰  Wait a bit for the installation process to complete. When you get a Success! message, you're good to move on to the next step!! ðŸŽ‰

Step 2: Run the Studio locally
Having installed the studio in the previous step, itâ€™s time to start it up and run it in your browser!

ðŸ‘‰ Enter the Studio's directory:

If you chose a custom output path, remember to change it respectively.

cd sanity-project

ðŸ‘‰ Run this command within the Studio's folder:
